**Thinkdots** is a living, breathing knowledge exploration tool. It takes any concept and explodes it into a beautiful, interactive constellation of connected ideas, powered by Generative AI.

> _“In a world of information, the most valuable thing is the connection between the dots.”_

## ✨ Features that Make it 10/10

- **🧩 Conceptual Explosions**: Enter a topic, and watch as it bursts into a network of related thoughts.
- **🧠 Thinkdots AI Integration**: Uses Google's Gemini API to dynamically generate knowledge graphs in real-time.
- **🎥 Kinetic Camera Engine**: A smooth, physics-based camera that follows your focus with buttery 60 FPS transitions.
- **🌑 Cinematic Aesthetic**: Deep space visuals with glowing nodes, flowing particle streams, and glassmorphism UI.
- **⚡ Pro-Level Physics**: Each "dot" has mass and repulsion, making the graph feel alive and responsive to your touch.
- **🔎 Fuzzy Knowledge Base**: A built-in "Brain" with 50+ core concepts that works even when offline.

## 🛠️ The "No-Build" Magic (Technology)

As a student, you've probably seen complex setups with `npm install` and `vite build`. **Thinkdots** is different. It uses a **Modern No-Build** approach:

- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)**: We use the browser's native power to handle files. No compiler needed.
- **Canvas API**: Everything is rendered on a high-speed drawing surface for maximum performance.
- **Clean Architecture**: Decoupled modules for Physics, Rendering, and AI logic in the `src/` folder.

| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/main.js`      | The heart: handles the camera, mouse, and rendering loop.     |
| `src/knowledge.js` | The memory: contains the static knowledge base (the "Brain"). |
| `src/gemini.js`    | The soul: connects to the AI to generate new nodes.           |
| `src/style.css`    | The skin: beautiful Glassmorphism and UI animations.          |
| `public/`          | Home for images and static assets.                            |

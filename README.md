# 🧠 ThinkDots-**Turn thoughts into constellations.**

ThinkDots is an AI-powered knowledge exploration engine that transforms any concept into a living network of connected ideas. Explore knowledge visually as glowing, dynamic dots that move, connect, and evolve instead of reading static text.

## ✨ Features

- 🔵 **Interactive Idea Graphs** – Visualize concepts as nodes and connections.  
- 🤖 **Powered by Gemini AI** – Generate real-time constellations for any topic.  
- 🌌 **Living Constellations** – Ideas animate and interact like a living system.  
- 🎥 **Kinetic Camera** – Smooth physics-based pan, zoom, and auto-centering.  
- 🔍 **Fuzzy Search** – Find topics quickly with intelligent matching.  
- ⚡ **No-Build ESM** – Open instantly in any modern browser.

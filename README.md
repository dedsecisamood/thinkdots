# Thinkdots - My personal knowledge explorer

Thinkdots is a project I built to help me (and anyone else) visualize how ideas connect. Instead of just reading a list of facts, you get to see them as a constellation of glowing dots that move and react to each other.

I’ve always felt that the best way to learn something is to see the "big picture." This app lets you do exactly that. You can type in any topic—like Python programming or space history—and watch a network of related concepts pop up and connect.

### Why I made this

I think the way we usually learn things (in folders or long lists) is a bit boring and doesn't really show how one thing leads to another. I wanted to create something that feels "alive" and makes exploring new topics actually fun.

### How it works (keep it simple)

- **Visuals**: I used a custom physics engine so the dots bounce and pull on each other. It’s supposed to feel like a mini-universe of thoughts.
- **AI**: It uses the Gemini API to figure out what concepts should be connected when you search for something new.
- **Wikipedia**: If you want to dive deep into a specific dot, there's a button that takes you straight to the Wikipedia page for it.

### Getting it running

It's super simple because I didn't use any complicated build tools:

1. Download or clone this code.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start exploring!

I had a lot of fun building this and I hope you enjoy playing around with it.
